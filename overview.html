        <h2>General Overview</h2>

        <div class="container">
          <p>An important skill to know as a Direct Support Professional is how to practice appropriate and effective conflict resolution skills. This will be helpful to avoid unnecessary stress in the workplace as well as to empower your clients to become more independent and successful in social situations.</p>

          <p>One of the most important steps in effect conflict resolution is to practice active listening. This involves listening and really thinking about what the other person is communicating and attempting to understand their point of view. Do not simply wait for your turn to talk. Remember to practice active listening when interacting with clients in order to model this behavior.</p>

          <p>In addition to practicing their own conflict resolution skills in the workplace, DSP’s can also perform skills training with clients on conflict resolution. Helpful strategies for clients with Schizophrenia, PTSD, and Austism are included in more detail, though all clients can benefit from conflict resolution training.</p>

        <h2>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD):</h2>

        <div class="img">

        <div class="container">
          <p>“Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges” (CDC).</p>

          <p>What is important to remember is that ASD looks different for every individual that experiences it. No two people will exhibit the exact same behaviors, have the exact same tendencies, or problem solve in the same way. ASD is not a ‘one-size’ fits all diagnosis. There are signs and symptoms to acknowledge, listed below:</p>

          <ul><b>
            <li>Avoiding eye contact</li>
            <li>Wanting to be left alone</li>
            <li>Displaying a preference to not being touched, unless they are initiating the touch themselves</li>
            <li>A strong preference to maintain routine and expectations that are consistent</li>
            <li>Having trouble expressing feelings</li>
            <li>Not looking at objects when another individual points to them</li>
            <li>Repeating actions multiple times/li>
            <li>Experiencing social anxiety that impairs interactions</li>
            <li>Difficulty using spoken language to express feelings, actions, etc./li>
            <li>Difficulty regulating feelings </li>
            <li>Exhibit potentially self-injurious behavior in reaction to overstimulation, frustration, etc./li>
            <li>Difficulty understanding social cues</li>
          </b></ul>

        <h2>Schizophrenia:</h2>

        <div class="img">

      	</div>

        <div class="container">
          <p>Schizophrenia affects about 1% of the entire world population, with about 3.5 million people in the U.S. diagnosed (SARDAA). Causes of this disability range from environmental factors present before birth, unbalanced brain chemistry, substance abuse, and genetics (NAMI.org).</p>

          <p>Despite different beginnings, schizophrenia can be categorized by a few specific factors. These include delusions and hallucinations, depression, extreme behavior, and impulsive actions. Additionally, what makes schizophrenia so dangerous is the prevalence of anosognosia as well, or what is known as “lack of insight” (NAMI.org). With this comes a sometimes apathetic attitude to one’s health and treatment, creating conflict in care.</p>

          <p>Schizophrenia is treated using antipsychotic medications, various forms of therapy, and through education for those who experience this disability.</p>

        <h2>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):</h2>

        <div class="img">
      		<img src="img/ptsd.jpg">
      	</div>

        <div class="container">
          <p>PTSD is generally categorized as a disorder that develops after someone has experienced or witnessed a particularly terrifying or shocking event. “People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened even when they are not in danger” (NIMH.gov).</p>

          <p>PTSD can be categorized as acute, meaning short-term (recovery within 6 months) or chronic, with individuals experiencing symptoms for much longer. Those who experience PTSD face frightening, uncontrollable thoughts, severe flashbacks, and terrifying dreams. This can lead individuals to withdraw from the society around them in an effort to cope. Some may also make serious life changes to avoid repeating the event they perceive as the start of their psychosis.</p>

          <h3>Other signs of PTSD include:</h3>

          <ul><b>
            <li>Poor memory regarding the traumatic event</li>
            <li>Loss of interest in their normal routine</li>
            <li>Severe mood change</li>
            <li>Detachment from friends and loved ones</li>
          </b></ul>

          <p>Like many other disorders, PTSD is unique to the individual that experiences it. Sometimes medication will be prescribed, like antidepressants, and other times therapy is used. Both can be effective alone or combined, depending on the severity of the experience and coping mechanisms already employed by the individual experiencing it.</p>

        <h2>PICA:</h2>

        <div class="img">
      		<img src="img/pica.jpg">
      	</div>

        <div class="container">
          <p>PICA is a disorder in which those who experience it “compulsively eat items that have no nutritional value” (HealthLine). While these items may be relatively harmless in nature, they can also be dangerous, making this disorder potentially deadly and very harmful.</p>

          <p>Due to the serious nature of PICA, once diagnosed the goal is to eradicate the disorder as soon as possible. Although this eating disorder is the same in practice in every individual, the frequency and items ingested vary instance to instance. One person may ingest rocks while another may ingest things like safety pins. Additionally, PICA has been linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder, which again reflects the extremely unique nature of this disorder.</p>
