        <p>As a Direct Support Professional, there is a considerable amount of responsibility and knowledge that goes into caring for individuals experiencing developmental disabilities. It can often feel daunting to pursue this career field when one does not feel they have the knowledge or background to properly serve this population.</p>

        <p>In this struggle, we are here to help. With Oregon facing a genuine crisis in their need for Direct Support Professionals, it is our mission to create a space that new-hires in this field can reference from and refresh themselves. We will provide a general overview of commonly experienced developmental disabilities, information regarding nutrition pertaining to these disabilities, and general conflict-resolution tactics for situations that may arise.</p>

        <p>It is our hope that these overviews will serve as a cheat sheet when applicable, and help the new Direct Support Professional feel more adequately prepared when they are working in the field. With more knowledge, we can create more confident and competent DSPs, ensuring the needs of the clients in this field are met.</p>

        <p>Now, let’s get started…</p>
