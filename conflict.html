        <h2>Conflict Resolution</h2>

        <div class="container clearfix">
          <p>An important skill to know as a Direct Support Professional is how to practice appropriate and effective conflict resolution skills. This will be helpful to avoid unnecessary stress in the workplace as well as to empower your clients to become more independent and successful in social situations.</p>

          <p>One of the most important steps in effect conflict resolution is to practice active listening. This involves listening and really thinking about what the other person is communicating and attempting to understand their point of view. Do not simply wait for your turn to talk. Remember to practice active listening when interacting with clients in order to model this behavior.</p>

          <p>In addition to practicing their own conflict resolution skills in the workplace, DSP’s can also perform skills training with clients on conflict resolution. Helpful strategies for clients with Schizophrenia, PTSD, and Austism are included in more detail, though all clients can benefit from conflict resolution training.</p>

        <h2>Autism:</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>Individuals with Autism often have a difficult time communicating with others and may be particularly uncomfortable navigating stressful interpersonal situations. The following tips have been helpful in empowering individuals on the Autism spectrum and making them more comfortable in approaching conflicts:</p>
          <ol><b>
            <li>Remember that all feelings are alright to have.</li>
            <li>Separate your feelings about what someone is doing from your feelings about the person.</li>
            <li>Exercise empathy before you approach a conflict.</li>
            <li>If you need to calm down, walk away.</li>
            <li>Listen as well as talk.</li>
            <li>Try to see the other person as being on the same side.</li>
          </b></ol>

          <p>Cited resource <a href="https://www.disabled-world.com/health/neurology/autism/conflicts.phphere">here</a>.</p>

          <p>Keep in mind that practice makes perfect. Conflict resolution is a difficult task for anyone, so reassure your clients that it is okay to not be as successful as they wish to be on their first attempt. Role playing is helpful in these circumstances in order to practice real conversations (like a do-over, what could you have done differently, etc.) or potential conversations (ones that could occur, but have not yet). The more experience you have practicing a skill, the more comfortable it will become and the easier it will get. Stay positive.</p>

        <h2>Schizophrenia:</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>A large amount of research has been conducted on the effectiveness of conflict resolution training for individuals with schizophrenia. As schizophrenia can seriously inhibit social interaction, it is important to teach and model appropriate behavior in less than ideal situations. Studies show that structured, repeated theme-based trainings with both material delivery and role playing are most effective for individuals with schizophrenia. This way, information is delivered, repeated, put into practice, and can be improved upon in future sessions. The more reinforcement and opportunity to put the skills learned into action the better. Most programs also include specific focus on active listening and communicating one’s own needs/ point of view while still being open to hear that of someone else.</p>

          <p>Some topics for class sessions/ training courses include: Compromise/ Negotiation, How to Leave a Stressful Situation, Disagreeing without Arguing, Responding to Untrue Accusations, and Making Apologies.</p>

        <h2>PTSD:</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>PTSD can have an extreme impact on an individual’s ability to respond to situations in which they feel threatened. Thus, effective conflict resolution is an important skill for clients with PTSD to develop. Sorting out what emotions and needs are underlying the issue at hand is an important first step. Try to help your clients assess what it is they are feeling and thinking during a conflict and what they want or need from the interaction. Let them know that it is okay to walk away from a stressful situation in order to regroup and think, rather than reacting on emotions. This is a difficult task. Reassure your clients that they are not expected to be perfect on their first try. The more they practice, the easier it will get.</p>

          <p>Not only is it important for individuals with PTSD to work on their conflict resolution skills, it is also imperative for those close to them and DSP’s working with them to be equipped with relevant background information and ways to prevent conflict from escalating. A basic understanding of trauma and its impacts is of utmost importance. Always try to anticipate and prepare for PTSD triggers. Do not take PTSD symptoms personally, remember that they are a defense mechanism for the underlying experience. Do not pressure someone with PTSD into talking, simply create a safe environment and make it known to them that you are available if/when they would like to discuss what they are thinking and feeling.
