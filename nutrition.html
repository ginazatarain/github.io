        <h2>Nutrition</h2>

        <div class="container clearfix">
          <p>A well-balanced diet is vital for good health and wellbeing. This becomes even more important when dealing with people who live with disabilities. Many disabled individuals experience nutritional deficiencies. Food provides our bodies with the energy, protein, essential fats, vitamins and minerals to live, grow and function properly so it is essential that these individuals have a well-balanced diet.</p>


          <h3>In general a healthy diet includes:</h3>
          <ul><b>
            <li>A variety of vegetables</li>
            <li>A variety of fruits</li>
            <li>Grains, at least half of which are whole grains</li>
            <li>Fat-free or low-fat dairy, including milk, yogurt, cheese, and/or fortified soy beverages</li>
            <li>A variety of protein foods, including:
              <ul><li>seafood</li>
                <li>lean meats</li>
                <li>poultry</li>
                <li>eggs</li>
                <li>legumes</li>
                <li>nuts</li>
                <li>seeds</li>
                <li>soy products</li></ul>
              </li>
            <li>Healthy Oils</li>
          </b></ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Autism</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>Children and adults with autism are at risk for an inactive lifestyle and obesity. People with autism can have problems with sensory processing, eating behaviors, and feeding disorders. It is estimated that 46% to 89% of patients with ASD experience some kind of problem-eating behavior (Privett, 2013). Some feeding difficulties revolve around changes in routine, this can be refusal to eat unless they sit in the same place, eat on the same dishes and eat the same foods daily. Feeding difficulties can also occur in the area of sensory processing. Some patients are hypersensitive to sounds, they may not want to eat in a noisy area or with others engaged in conversation. If they have visual sensitivities, they may accept foods only of certain colors. They also may not be able to eat foods that are touching each other on their plate. People with autism also may avoid certain foods because of the food’s texture.</p>

          <p>Privett,, D. (2013, January). Autism Spectrum Disorder — Research Suggests Good Nutrition May Manage Symptoms. Today’s Dietitian, 15(1).</p>

          <p>Each day your dietary choices matter. What you eat affects your health — how you feel today, tomorrow, and even years from now.</p>

        <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>People living with schizophrenia tend to eat less healthily with more fat and less fiber in their diet. They also tend to exercise less and are less likely to go to the doctor when they do suspect a physical ailment. They can tend to have a higher incidence of physical ailments such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart problems. A well balanced diet is important because of weight gain associated with antipsychotic medication. It is important to balance blood sugar, avoid stimulants, increase essential fats and up antioxidants.</p>

          <p>We build our brain from specialised essential fats. An enzyme that breaks down essential fats in the brain is often overactive in people with schizophrenia, and this leads to a greater need for these fats.</p>

          <p>How to increase essential fats:</p>
          <p>Eat fish at least twice a week. The best fish are Mackerel, Herring/kipper, Sardines, fresh tuna( no more than three times a month because of mercury levels), Anchovy, Salmon and Trout.</p>

          <p>Seeds on most days. Flax seeds and pumpkin seeds are the best. Flax seeds are so small they are best ground and sprinkled on cereal. Supplemental omega-3 oils</p>

          <p><b>How to up antioxidants:</b></p>
          <p>Eat lots of fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables with a variety of colours</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>Eating or not eating has consequences that range from mental to emotional to physical, which makes nutrition very important in PTSD. It is important to have a well balanced diet to help your body deal with tension and stress. The diet plan should include foods that are high in vitamin B12 and avoid foods that further stress the body such as, processed foods, alcohol, fatty foods, caffeine, refined sugar, and refined flours. Caffeine stimulates the adrenal gland to release adrenaline leading to increased stress and anxiety.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Pica</h2>
        <div class="container">
          <p>Eating non-food objects can interfere with eating healthy food, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies. Strange cravings can sometimes be triggered by not getting enough nutrients, including iron and zinc, so it is important to incorporate these minerals into the diet plan.</p>
